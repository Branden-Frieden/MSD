 1. Where is the assertEquals method defined? What does it do? Can we use assertEquals for more than just int types? (Hint: Consult the API for JUnit)

  assertEquals is defined in the library for junit.jupiter.API
  it allows us to check that 2 values are equal and throws an error if they aren't
  it can be used for lots of types other than int, basically any object

2. Briefly describe what each of the three tests is checking.

  whether the empty array returns -1;
  if an array of equal numbers returns 0;
  if a randomish array returns the correct value;

3. Why is our unimplemented findSmallestDiff method passing one of the tests?

  the second test is expecting 0 and our test wants it to be 0 as well

4. Why are we failing the third test? How should our method be modified to correct this?

  negative numbers mess it up becuase a negative difference is the same as
  positive, but will always register as lower.
  to fix it, take the absolute value of the difference


5. What is the appropriate call to assertEquals for your new test (test 4)?

  assertEquals(2, DiffUtil.findSmallestDiff( arr4 ));

6. Provide one more test (test 5) for the findSmallestDiff method. Briefly describe your test and write the call to assertEquals here.

  this one tests an array that has been given a size, but don't have any
  values put into it, its essentially filled with 0's, so we expect 0.

  assertEquals(0, DiffUtil.findSmallestDiff( arr5 ));

7. Briefly describe your unit tests for Assignment 1
