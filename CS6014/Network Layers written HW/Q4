    How many subnets are a part of this network, and what is the smallest IP prefix (i.e. most fixed bits) that can be used to describe each one?


6 subnets
A:   1.1.1
B:   1.1.2
C:   1.1.3
A-B: 1.1.4
A-C: 1.1.5
B-C: 1.1.6


    If this network is somehow connected to the internet, what is the cheapest (i.e. smallest number of address) IP prefix the company could have purchased (without using NAT)?


1.1


    Assume the router for group A has 4 ports: port 1 is connected to the group subnet, port 2 is connected to router B, port 3 is connected to router C, and port D is connected to the ISP. Write out router A's forwarding table.

port1 	1.1.1.0
Port2 	1.1.2.0
Port3	1.1.3.0
Port4	1.1.4.0
