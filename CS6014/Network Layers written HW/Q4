    How many subnets are a part of this network, and what is the smallest IP prefix (i.e. most fixed bits) that can be used to describe each one?


6 subnets
A:   1.1.1 
B:   1.1.2
C:   1.1.3
A-B: 1.1.4
A-C: 1.1.5
B-C: 1.1.6

    If this network is somehow connected to the internet, what is the cheapest (i.e. smallest number of address) IP prefix the company could have purchased (without using NAT)?

00000001.00000001.00000 -> 21 bits

    Assume the router for group A has 4 ports: port 1 is connected to the group subnet, port 2 is connected to router B, port 3 is connected to router C, and port D is connected to the ISP. Write out router A's forwarding table.

Adress			Port
1.1.1.0/24		1
1.1.2.0/24		2
1.1.3.0/24		3
1.1.4.0			2
1.1.5.0			3
1.1.6.0			2 or 3
destination(ISP)	4
