What data is being sent to the other computer?
	we are sending 64Bytes including, the version, header length, checksum, flags, 	identification, protocols 
	source and destination addresses and 48 bytes of data. The addresses are our computers addresses.
	This matches the example in class for the packet headers
Ping time:
	the ping time between out computers was anywhere from 10 to 100 ms but usually around 10 ms
	for google, the ping time was consistently around 33 ms
	for the louve, the ping was around 150ms,
	this shows us that the farther away a network is, the longer the ping
HTTP
	4 packets were sent to access the example site, this is less than I expected, but for how simple the site is I guess it makes sense
	the data is encrypted so you can't know what was sent, but it should be a bunch of the usual header stuff + the html data for the site
Curl
	used for sending/receiving data to/from a server using protocols
	this time I got the HTML file layer out in the terminal and the results in wireShark are not encrypted so you can see the HTML in there too.
	

	GitHub automatically changed HTTP to HTTPS
	you can't understand the wireshark output because its incrypted
	the first few messages aren't encrypted because I typed in HTTP and not HTTPS, but GitHub switched me over to encryption pretty quick
